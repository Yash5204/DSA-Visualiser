## 📘 DSA-Visualiser

An interactive web-based tool to animate and teach data structures and algorithms. Built with plain HTML/CSS/JavaScript. Focused on clarity and learning efficiency.

---

### 🎯 Project Goals

* Visualize core DSA concepts (e.g. sorting, searching, graph traversal) with animations
* Help learners understand algorithm steps, comparisons, swaps, and runtimes
* Serve as a teaching aid or coding-study companion

### 🛠️ Features

* Visual animations for **Sorting** (e.g. bubble, merge, quick) and **Searching**
* Possibly module support for **Graphs**, **Trees**, etc. 
* Step-by-step execution highlights operations (comparison/swap counts)
* Speed control or pausing

### ⚙️ Installation & Running

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Yash5204/DSA-Visualiser.git  
cd DSA-Visualiser  
open index.html           # No build tools needed  
```

### ✅ Usage Guide

* Choose an algorithm category (sorting/searching/graph)
* Enter custom input or use default dataset
* Use play/pause/reset controls to step through logic
* Optional: side-by-side “race” mode for comparison
* Display metrics: comparisons, swaps, runtime

---

### 📈 Metrics Collected

* Total comparisons
* Total swaps or steps
* Execution time (if supported)
